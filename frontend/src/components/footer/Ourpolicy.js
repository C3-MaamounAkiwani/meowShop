             <li>you receive the wrong item</li>
             <li>you do not want the product you have received (but you must return the item at your expense and the item must be unused)</li>

             <li> your order does not arrive due to exceptional circumstances outside our control (e.g. not cleared by customs, delayed by a natural disaster).</li>
